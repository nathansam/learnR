# Why learn R?

Whilst  software such as SPSS and Graphpad Prism are great for simple analyses,
they are not particularly flexible. R is a Statistical programming language
which allows you to transform data into a format which is suitable for analysis,
and then perform that analysis.

R is also highly extensible, with a rich ecosystem of extensions (known as
packages) which allow you to perform a wide variety of analyses. 

Finally, R can be used to perform highly reproducible analyses. 

## Why not Python?

Python is the other popular language for data science. It is a general purpose
language also used for a wide variety of tasks outside of data science, such as
web development and automation. Python is particularly popular amongst those who
do  machine learning, an area where R typically lags behind. However, R is still
the language of choice for many statisticians and data scientists due to its
rich ecosystem of packages, its focus on data analysis, and history of being
used to produce great graphics. Moreover, R is typically more popular in
biomedical research which results in cutting edge developments in this field
typically being implemented in R first.

As such, I would recomend those working in biomedical research to learn R first.
However, Python is an excellent language to learn later if you have the time
and are interested in machine learning.
